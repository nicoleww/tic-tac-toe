<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The aim of this project was to create a functioning game of tic-tac-toe.</p>
<p>The players must switch turns claiming the squares on the board until one player has 3 in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Once that goal is achieved, the player is declared winner. If no player claims 3 squares in a row before the board is full, the game is a tie.</p>
